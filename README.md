# Lichess Search

Lichess Search is a single-page application that utilizes the [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api) to allow a user to search for Lichess players by username and see their ratings and recent games. This application allows a user to see all of a player's recent games together, regardless of time format.

### Features

- Displays a player's recent games

One of endpoints that I used streams its responses as NDJSON.
